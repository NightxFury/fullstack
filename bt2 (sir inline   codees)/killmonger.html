        <h1>KillMonger</h1>
        <p>
            Killmonger (Erik Stevens) is one of Marvel's most compelling and complex villains, appearing in Black Panther. 
            Born as Erik Stevens, he is a highly skilled soldier with a brilliant tactical mind and intense combat abilities. 
            Driven by the trauma of losing his family and witnessing systemic injustice, Killmonger seeks to challenge Wakanda's 
            traditions and claim the throne to reshape the world in his vision. Though he stands as an antagonist to T'Challa, 
            his motivations reveal deep pain, ambition, and a desire for empowerment, 
            making him one of Marvel's most memorable and thought-provoking characters.
